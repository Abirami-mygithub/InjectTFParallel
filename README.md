# InjectTFParallel
InjectTFParallel is a python based software that helps to test the reliability of non-sequential deep learning models. Hardware faults like bit flips, flip to all zeroes can be simulated with the help of this software. One can specify the layer name where the fault is to be injected, fault type and probability of fault injection in a configuration file in yaml format. The model is evaluated with the fault injected into the specified layer and accuracy, loss and confusion matrix is computed. Intermediate layer outputs can also be visualized, so as to get better understanding of the overall behavior of the model while injecting fault.
